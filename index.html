					<p class="block">Welcome! My name is Shanice Smith. I use she/they pronouns and identify as a queer neurodiverse Black woman. I'm a data-driven and people-first Software Engineer based in New York City. My work values are transparency, collaboration, and leading with empathy. I'm currently working at Twitter, building out internal tooling and automation efforts for platform teams. JavaScript, Python, and Java are constantly in my toolbelt!</p>
					
					<p class="block">I recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in Emerging Media Technology from CUNY City Tech in 2021 where I doubled as a full-time student and 8x intern across the tech industry. In my free time, I enjoy volunteering in the tech community, listening to podcasts, watching musicals, and spending time on my Peloton bike.</p>

					<p class="block">As for my previous experience, I've had internships in Software Engineering (Front-end and Back-end), Quality Assurance Automation, and Data Analysis. I've worked with internal stakeholders to resolve key issues regarding automation, accessibility, developer experience, and data collection. This work ranges from the start-up level to multinational operations, such as NBCUniversal, Disney, and Electronic Arts.</p>
					
					<p>Still early in my career, I identify as a generalist. I'm taking my time to enjoy a variety of technical roles across the tech stack, but my main interests are in developer experience, technical writing, internal tooling, and automation. For more detailed information on my experience and skills, check out my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13umTG5JzljnSVABGkPIL_-8evxtUQVJ3/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resume</a> or send an email over to <a href="mailto:hello@shanice.dev">hello@shanice.dev</a>.</p>
