            Welcome! My name is Shanice. I use she/they pronouns and identify as
            a queer neurodiverse Black woman. I'm a data-driven, people-first
            Software Engineer. I currently work at the ACLU on the Educate team, building out the user experiences and interactive components for the ACLU.org and supported websites.
          </p>

          <p class="block">
            I'm a CUNY graduate based in New York City, where I studied
            Emerging Media Technology and Game Design. In my free time, I enjoy
            volunteering in the tech community, learning new skills, watching
            musicals, and spending time on my Peloton bike.
          </p>

          <p class="block">
            As for my previous experience, I've had internships in front-end,
            back-end, quality assurance automation, and data analysis. I've
            collaborated with internal stakeholders to resolve key issues regarding
            automation, accessibility, developer experience, and data
            collection. This work ranges from the start-up level to
            multinational operations, such as NBCUniversal, Disney,
            Electronic Arts, and Twitter.
          </p>

          <p>
            My main interests are in developer experience, front-end
            development, accessibility, internal tooling, and automation.
            However, I still identify as a generalist and enjoy a variety of
            technical roles across the tech stack. Transparency, frequent communication, and leading with
            empathy are the core values I follow in and out of the workplace. For more detailed information
            on my experience and skills, check out my
